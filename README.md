eXist-db messaging-replication extension
========================================

This is the eXist-db extension providing 'messaging' and 'document replication' features based on [JMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service) technology.

Please consult the [WiKi](https://github.com/eXist-db/messaging-replication/wiki) for documentation and more information about this extension.

The repo contains a number or ready-to-go examples for the [messaging](https://github.com/eXist-db/messaging-replication/tree/develop/web/demo/messaging) and the [replication](https://github.com/eXist-db/messaging-replication/tree/develop/web/demo/replication) features. Recommended is to start with the messaging feature first

The extension has been made possible with the funds of a number of [sponsors](https://github.com/eXist-db/messaging-replication/wiki/Sponsors).
